# 🌿 RePouch Dashboard

**RePouch Dashboard** is a full-stack project developed using **React** (frontend) and **Django** (backend), built to support the RePouch sustainability initiative that promotes eco-friendly refills and pouch returns to reduce plastic waste.

Currently, the frontend and backend are developed **independently**, and integration is planned for future updates.

source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
